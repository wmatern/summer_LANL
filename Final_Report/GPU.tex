\subsection{Introduction to GPUs}
\label{GPU}
Graphics Processing Units (GPU) are typically used for accelerating graphics intensive applications. While these devices have been optimized for such applications, their ability to process significant data is parallel can also be harnessed for more general use. Because of recent advances in software, general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is an alternative to using additional CPUs for executing a program. GPGPU has the additional economic advantage of providing a greater number of floating point operations per second (FLOPS) per dollar.
