\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}
\label{conclusions}

From the above diagrams it is apparent that the MUSCL scheme was most effective at preventing diffusion of material interfaces. However, the MUSCL is the most expensive scheme and also unnaturally sharpens normally smooth waves as is evident from the evolution of the initially Gaussian distribution. The SUPG scheme gradually diffuses the solution while the Lax-Wendroff TVD and the MPDATA schemes are overly dissipative. The choice of method is therefore problem specific and most production scale codes should have the option to switch between algorithms. Several of these schemes have been implemented in a Euler equation solver for further testing and stability analysis. Additionally, we are in the process of applying the ACM to a threaded GPU shallow water equation solver. A mixed finite element/finite difference approach for the Euler equations was unsuccessful and thus a full finite element approach is planned.
